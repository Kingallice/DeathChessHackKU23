This game was inspired by our desire to take a classic game everyone knows and mix it up just enough to keep things interesting without losing the too much of strategy of Chess.

Death Chess!  A mix of classic chess and a small fighting game, Death Chess was made with the purpose of mixing up the chess formula in a small but unique way.  The game plays like classic chess up until a piece is captured, at which point the capturing piece and captured piece battle each other to see whether the piece being attacked is successfully captured, or if the attacking piece is .taken instead

The way it works is simple, capture a piece to initiate battle, at which point the two pieces, each with their own stats based on their type, will attack each other.  The white piece always takes the left, and is controlled using WASD to move and F to attack.  Black takes the right, using the arrow keys to move and L to attack.  Depending on which team initiates the attack, the winner will either capture the piece as per normal chess, or keep their piece while the enemy piece is taken instead.
